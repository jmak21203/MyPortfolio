# MyPortfolio

When designing this page I really was aiming for something that would work as my story and depication of my work. I also wanted something that would be easy to edit and change as my profile/body of work grew. 

It solves a pretty simple problem of giving a hiring manager or someone curious about my work a single place of origin to have access to everything that I consider important and relevant.

This process has been painful but rewarding and educational. I have spent way more time on this than I will in the future. My understanding of flex boxes and how to properly format is exceptionally better now that when I started. I also learned about image in the html vs image in the background input via css. While learning this I also learned how you save your jpg files matters. After some research I learned there are ideal width x height properties based on where the image will sit in your website.
